The Digital Lock Circuit project is a simple yet effective security system that uses an EEPROM to store passwords and control access to a device or area. The circuit is implemented without using a microcontroller, making it a cost-effective and reliable solution.

There are two types of passwords in this system. The first password is for regular users and is formed from 4 digits. The second password is for the administrator and is formed from 6 digits. If a user enters the wrong password twice, the system requires the administrator to enter their password to open the lock.

The circuit has six LEDs that indicate the number of digits entered by the user. There is also an LED that indicates whether the system is open or closed. Another LED indicates which attempt the user is on. If the LED is off, the user is on their first attempt. If the LED is on, it means the user is on their second attempt. There is also an LED that indicates whether the user is entering the administrator password or not.

If the administrator enters the wrong password, the system stops completely and needs to be reset.

This Digital Lock Circuit project is ideal for securing devices such as safes, lockers, or even homes. The use of an EEPROM allows for easy password programming and storage, and the LED indicators provide a clear indication of the system's status.

Overall, the Digital Lock Circuit project is a great way to implement a secure access control system without using a microcontroller, making it a perfect choice for hobbyists and DIY enthusiasts who want to build their own security system.

# Project Sections
The project is composed of four key elements: a numerical keypad, a memory unit, a notification panel, and a clock circuit. Together, these components form a functional system for a specific purpose, although the exact nature of that purpose is not specified. The numerical keypad is used to input data, which is then stored in the memory unit. The notification panel provides feedback to the user, indicating the status of the system or the input provided. The clock circuit helps to keep track of time or other relevant metrics, depending on the specific application of the system.
